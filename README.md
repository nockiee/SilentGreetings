## For Players

- Use the commands to interact and have fun with others!
- HEX colors will display beautifully in chat (Minecraft 1.16+)
- If a command doesn't work, check the cooldown or required distance

---

## For Developers

- Written in Java using the PaperMC API
- Each command is implemented as a separate handler class
- All customization is done via `config.yml` (no need to recompile)
- To build from source:
    ```sh
    mvn clean package
    ```
- To add new commands or messages, extend the config and add new handlers
